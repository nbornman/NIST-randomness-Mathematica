# NIST-randomness-Mathematica
This notebook is a Mathematica implementation of the standard NIST randomness test suite (which is usually implemented using Python). It was NOT written by me (Nicholas Bornman) and I claim no ownership. It was written by Ilja Gerhardt &amp; Nick Galbreath, under a BSD licence. I have simply found it very useful. I only wrote the 'Graphics' &amp; 'RN test' sections.
